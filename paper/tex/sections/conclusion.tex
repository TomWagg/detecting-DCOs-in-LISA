We provide predictions for the detection rate and population properties of LISA detectable BHBH, BHNS and NSNS.
%
We use a novel empirically-informed analytical model for the metallicity dependent star formation history of the Milky Way, calibrated against the APOGEE stellar spectroscopic survey. We use this to model Monte-Carlo realisations of the present-day BHBH, BHNS and NSNS populations in our Milky Way. 
%
For the binary population, we use the results of a large grid of simulations performed with the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS\edit1{, which can reproduce the current constraints on the overall GW rates \citep{Broekgaarden+2021,Broekgaarden+2021b, Abbott+2021_GWTC3}}. Our suite of simulations consider 20 physics variations, which represent the most common uncertainties in binary physics.
%
We investigate the detectability of sources in the planned space-based GW detector LISA using the LEGWORK package \citep{Wagg+2021}, that we specifically developed for this purpose and is publicly available. 
%
We investigate the results expected for a 4- and 10-year LISA mission. Our main conclusions can be summarised as:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Total detections:} We predict \rangeFourYear{} detections in a 4-year LISA mission, across all our simulations for varying physics assumptions. This increases to about \rangeTenYear{} for a 10-year LISA mission. Although the number of detections per type can vary by about 2 orders of magnitude, we find that the total detection rate is fairly robust, among the variations we have considered (see Table~\ref{tab:detection_rates}).
    
    \item \textbf{Detections by type:} For our fiducial model, we predict a total of $124 \pm 11$ detections and out of these we find about $\BHBHFourYear{}\pm 9$ BHBHs, $\BHNSFourYear{}\pm 6$ BHNSs and $\NSNSFourYear{}\pm 3$ NSNSs. The errors quoted here are the $1$-$\sigma$ Poisson uncertainties resulting from the random initialisation of the Milky Way (see Table~\ref{tab:detection_rates}).
    
    \item \textbf{Physics variations:} Among the model variations we consider, we find that our predictions for the rates for the different DCO types are robust within a factor of 2 of the fiducial rate, with the following exceptions. For BHBHs, the rate is most sensitive to the treatment of common envelope phases or an increase of the WR wind mass loss. For BHNSs and NSNSs, the assumptions regarding the assumed common envelope ejection efficiency, treatment of case BB mass transfer and the kicks are most important. In addition, the assumed mass transfer efficiency impacts the BHNS (see Fig.~\ref{fig:detection_rates}).
    
    \item \textbf{Probing the black hole mass distribution and the lower mass gap:} We expect LISA to predominantly detect lower mass BHs (with 90\% of BHBH and BHNSs having BH masses lower than $11 \unit{M_\odot}$ in our fiducial simulations). This is in stark contrast to current ground-based detectors which are heavily biased towards high mass systems, since they can be detected out to larger distances. We predict that between 15-156 systems with a component with a mass between $2.5$-$5 \unit{M_\odot}$ would be detected by a 4-year LISA, for our different physics variations. An exception is model using the Fryer Rapid remnant mass prescription, which produces none. However, it will likely be hard for LISA data to make a significant impact on this debate on the existence of the lower mass gap given the uncertainty of the individual masses (see Fig.~\ref{fig:lower_mass_gap_variation}).
    
    \item \textbf{Eccentricity distribution:} We find that for all DCO types a large fraction of detectable systems still have nonzero eccentricities ($e > 0.01$) when entering the LISA band, which can be used to distinguish them from the more numerous WDWD binaries, which are largely expected to be circular. In particular, for our fiducial model, we find that this is the case for around three quarters of detectable binaries. Furthermore, around 16\% of detectable binaries have eccentricities that are so high ($e > 0.3$) that the emission at frequencies corresponding to higher order harmonics start to dominate (see Fig.~\ref{fig:fiducial_pdf_distributions}).
    
    \item \textbf{Distinguishing from WDWD sources:} For about half of all detections we expect that we will be able to confidently determine the type of compact objects involved and this increases to 60\% for a 10-year LISA mission (see Sec.~\ref{sec:WDWD_distinguish}).
    
    \item \textbf{Chirp mass determinations:} For about 10\% of systems we expect to be able to determine the chirp mass better than 10\% and this increases to 15\% for a 10-year LISA mission (see Fig.~\ref{fig:m_c_unc}).

    \item \textbf{Prospects for finding EM counterparts:} We expect about 13\% of detections with a sky localisation better than 1 degree for our fiducial model (though the fraction remains roughly constant among model variations). This fraction remains the same for a 10-year LISA mission, meaning that the number increases proportionally. This will be of interest for electromagnetic searches for counterparts, in particular for radio pulsar searches with SKA (see Fig.~\ref{sec:pulsar_matching}).
 
   \item \textbf{Benefits of extending the LISA mission:} The number of detections scale approximately as $\sqrt{T_{\rm obs}}$, where $T_{\rm obs}$ is the mission length. Therefore, extending the LISA mission from 4- to 10-years increases the number of detections by about 60\% for each model variation. A further important benefit is the improvement of the characterisation of the sources, since the relative error on the frequency derivative (which dominates the relative error in the chirp mass) scales as $T_{\rm obs}^{-2.5}$ for stationary sources (Eq.~\ref{eq:f_orb_dot_unc}). We find that the number of systems with chirp masses that can be measured better than 10\% increases by a factor of 2.4 for each model variation.
   In addition, the number of systems with a sky localisation better than one degree increases by a factor of 1.5. Overall, the number of sources that can be unambiguously distinguished from WDWDs increases by almost a factor of 2 (see Section~\ref{sec:WDWD_distinguish}).
