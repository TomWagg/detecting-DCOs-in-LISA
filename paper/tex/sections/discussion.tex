GCs don't produce DNSs well but the other ones yes

Contribution of metal poor stars is not well known

\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard pop synth limitations
    \item Systemic kicks
    \item No models for high $Z$ values in Frankel
    \item Other channels
    \item Only a single disc for the Milky Way
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Identification of GW sources}
It is important to note that, though we present predictions for the detection rates of specific DCO types, the nature of the source may not be immediately apparent from the gravitational wave signal.
