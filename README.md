# Detecting Double Compact Objects in LISA
A collection of functions and demos for how to work out which DCOs from a COMPAS data file are detectable with LISA

Each function is explained in the demos and there are comments in each of the .py file. If it seems like this would useful for people I may write more detailed documentation/turn it into a real Python package. For now, you just need to import whichever .py files you need.

Let me know if anything is unclear or you find a bug! :)
